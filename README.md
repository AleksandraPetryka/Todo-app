## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Hooks - useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext
- TypeScript


### What I learned
- Understanding of TypeScript with React.
- How to use React Hooks especially useState, useEffect, useRef.
- How to use Context API as global data in functional components.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#pl) - This helped me finally understand Flexbox CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
